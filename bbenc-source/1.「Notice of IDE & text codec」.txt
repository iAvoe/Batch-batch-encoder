「IDE」
 - This project was coded on Notepad, VSCode & PowerShell ISE. It's recommended to develop (e.g., port to another coding language) with integrated development environment (IDE) with colorcoding & comfy interface due to the sheer amount of content

「utf8+BOM text codec is required for PowerShell」
 - Under the 4 horsemen of PowerShell, PowerShell ISE, CMD/batch & UTF-8 filenames. Only utf8+BOM text codec could work it out. However the generated CMD batches are coded with UTF-8NoBOM
 - PowerShell，PowerShell ISE shraightup fail to decode UTF-8NoBOM
 - CMD doesn't support Unicode（UTF-16LE？）
 - PowerShell 5.1 does not natively support UTF-8NoBOM
 - however PowerShell 7 mandate users to run scripts with purely commandline, which is not acceptable, and caused the later shift to realize some of PS7's features in PowserShell 5.1
